The run_analysis.R includes 3 functions that covers these parts of the assignment:

### complete.dataset() :
* 1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* 3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* 4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

### justmeanstd() :
* 2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

### splitmean() :
* 5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
